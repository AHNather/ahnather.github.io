									<h1>Credit Risk Analysis<br />
									</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Excel-based reports used for assessing credit risk and projecting future losses in a financial institution. The reports created include:
									Vintage Analysis Report: Analyzes how accounts' statuses change over time based on the number of months they’ve been active. This helps in predicting future delinquencies and defaults.
									Roll Rate Report: Tracks the migration of delinquent accounts through different stages, such as from Current to Delinquent or Charged-Off. This report is used to assess credit risk based on customer demographics and behavior.
									Loss Provisioning Report: Projects future losses by analyzing historical data and applying forecasting techniques to estimate how many accounts will likely end up in default, and how much loss the company can expect.
									New Growth Forecasting: Uses historical account performance to forecast the number of new accounts that will likely be charged-off in the future. This report helps in projecting the performance of new loans or accounts under similar demographic conditions.

								<p>Previously, I completed a 200-hour cooperative training at King Fahad Medical City, focusing on Microsoft Power BI, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server to support efficient data workflows. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with hands-on experience in a variety of AI and BI projects, from retail sales forecasting to quality of life analysis. This portfolio showcases projects that reflect my proficiency in using data to solve real-world challenges. I am eager to collaborate on innovative projects and continue advancing my skills in AI, data science, and business intelligence.</p>
