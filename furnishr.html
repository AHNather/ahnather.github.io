                                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                    <p>This project aimed to optimize Furnishr’s end-to-end home furnishing experience by addressing critical data challenges. With nearly 100k products in their catalog and low repeatability in design packages, the project focused on analyzing customer orders (2021–2024) to identify patterns, improve supplier relationships, and provide actionable insights for scalability, sourcing, and logistics.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Project Objectives</h4>
                                    <p>

                                        - Identify the most repeated products in the catalog.
                                        - Analyze popular product combinations for various room types.
                                        - Discover styles, colors, and product features that drive sales.
                                        - Develop interactive dashboards to provide insights for decision-making.
                                        - Offer recommendations to enhance supplier efficiency and reduce risks.</p>
